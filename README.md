# Adopt A Paw
A  web application that will allow users to look at, select and "adopt" animals.

## User Stories 
As a pet adopter I want to be able to create a profile and browse through the pets and learn more about each pet through their background so that I am able to submit and application throught the web site.

### Usage 
When you Browse Pets, you will be able to search though our extensive list of pets waiting for adoption. You can learn more by clicking on a pet's profile to read more about their background and needs. If you find a pet you'd love to adopt, submit an application that will be attached to your profile. In addition to that after approval you are able to arrange a meeting with the pet to ensure compatablity. After you will be able to finalize the adoption, and welcome your new family member home!
